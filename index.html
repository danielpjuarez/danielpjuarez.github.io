			<h3>
				My achievements:
			</h3>
			<p>In my time working in EMS I received very high marks on my charting capabilities, scoring a 93 on a scale of 1-100. In the last
			few years, I have received no (0) complaints from any clients or patients. I am also pleased to report that I have have personally
			revised two different emergency checklists, both of which earned praise for their readability and improvement over the old styles.
			Qualitatively, I am an independent worker, always capable of solo operation. The downside of that is I sometimes have difficulty
			adjusting to teamwork. I am also a very stable person who can be relied on, but this same stability can cause me to become somewhat
			rigid in how I approach problems. Finally, I don't like making mistakes. Although there are obvious benefits to that mentality,
			it can take me longer to accomplish tasks than it otherwise would.
			</p>
			<h3>Golden Circle</h3>
			<img src="images/goldentarget.png" alt="golden circle">
				<h4>Why?</h4>
				<p>I aim to make EMS charting software easier to use and more widely accessible. Current Electronic Patient Care Report (EPCR)
					suites suffer from lack of accessibility and/or poor usability, often requiring expensive,
					ruggedized hardware, always-on internet connections and other expensive barriers to entry.
					Web-based EPCR suites do not require specialized hardware, can scaled to meet an agency's needs,
					and empower rural EMS services to help gather critical research data that is currently in short supply,
					or low quality when it does exist.
				</p>
				<h4>How?</h4>
				<p>
					I am going to help develop such web-based software, leveraging my experience in EMS to build software that is
					intuitive, modular, and compatible with a wide range of hardware due to its web-based design.
				</p>
				<h4>What</h4>
				<p>I am an aspiring web developer who will be working hard to bring webapps into a new age of accessibility and quality.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
			<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>
			<p>Hello,
				My name is Daniel. I aspire to create and improve internet-based charting software to improve the quality and
				quantity of data gathered from EMS field crews. I plan to work with existing leaders in the field of
				internet-based charting solutions. Would you like to see my portfolio?

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
<!--			What did I learn this week? What felt like an accomplishment? -->
<!--			How have I grown from the experience? -->
<!--			How has my perception changed? Why do I love coding?-->
			<br>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p> This week I've learned a lot of technical stuff, of course. I also learned that coding is even
				more difficult than I anticipated and requires a level of concentration and attention to detail
				that dwarfs any of my previous expectations. Every time a webpage worked as it was supposed to it felt like
				both an accomplishment and a minor miracle. I feel like working through these problems made me more prepared
				for upcoming challenges.
				<br>
				My perception about coding has changed in that I feel like it's no longer an impossible journey, but
				a journey that, while difficult, will be possible with enough time and effort. I'm not sure I'm ready to
				say that I love coding, but I hope I will get there.
			</p>
			<h3>Week 2</h3>
